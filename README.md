A very simple page that I made for my girlfriend, so she can remember her cat that lives in the other side of the world.
Made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It has a login system with only one user, since I don't really know how to handle any more than that yet. Using a basic if (password === correctPassword) it shows a random message every day from an array of handwritten messages.
Nothing more, nothing less. Have a good day.
